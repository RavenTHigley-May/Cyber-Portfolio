description: Dureing this project I was asked to evaluate a projects directory and change permissions to make sure the project team did not have anyone outside of the user exicuting permissions. This project taught me how to find hidden files and use chmod to change permissions. As well as how to use ls -la to find what I need to know and check that I exicuted permissions properly.
